# express-mongo-starter

Boilerplate code for starting a new node/mongo project. Useful for hackathons.

- It already has authentication (using JWT as Bearer Token), so you can just start coding your business-stuff.
- Add your business-code as under the `modules` folder.
- It doesn't include any logging or testing code/template, so feel free to contribute!
- If you don't have mongo installed on your computer, run `docker-compose up` in root directory.

And thanks to [Hayati](https://github.com/hayatibis), I got most of the ideas in this repository from him.
